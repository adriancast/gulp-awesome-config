# What includes?

This configuration includes:

Keep in mind that if you want to use Livereload you must install an [addon] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei) to your browser.

* Run Less precompiler + Livereload:

  `gulp`

* Run Local server + Less + Livereload:

* Optimize your images:

To use this feature just put your images on the fixtures folder. If you are running `gulp` or `gulp server` will automatically optimize your images and copy them to the img folder.
